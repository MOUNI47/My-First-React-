      <h2>Welcome to React</h2>

      <p>
        React is a popular JavaScript library used to build fast and interactive
        user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components
        and manage application state efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this project, we are using <strong>functional components</strong> and
        <strong> JSX</strong> to design a simple webpage. JSX makes the code
        easier to read by allowing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application is divided into three components:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Header</strong> – Displays the title of the application</li>
        <li><strong>Content</strong> – Shows the main information</li>
        <li><strong>Footer</strong> – Displays copyright information</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This project helps in understanding the basic structure of a React
        application and how components work together to build a user interface.
      </p>
